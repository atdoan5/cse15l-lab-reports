# **Lab Report 1**
## `cd` command <br/>

**Example with no arguments** <br/>

<br/>
- I received no output when using the `cd` command with no arguments because it is basically changing the directory into nothing, therefore it is not changing the directory at all. This also means the current directory should be the same when running `pwd`.<br/>
- The output is not an error because using `cd` with nothing is not supposed to change anything.

**Example with `cd` into a *directory*** <br/>
![Image](images/example2.png) <br/>
- By using the `cd Lecture1/` command, my current working directory is changed to the Lecture1 folder which we can see with the `pwd` command. <br/>
- The output is not an error since I meant to change the directory to the Lecture1 folder.
